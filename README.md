The state is expressed as a permutation of 9 digits (from 0 to 8) which correspond to the tile numbers (0 being the empty tile). The tiles are listed from left to right and top to bottom. And so, the three starting states from the figure above correspond to the the following states:
* ‘easy’– [1,5,4,7,0,2,3,6,8] 
* ‘medium’– [0,2,5,7,4,3,6,1,8]
* ‘hard’– [7,2,4,5,0,6,8,3,1]
